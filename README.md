## API Testing framework for Postman Rest API

##‚ùì What is this Repository about?
This project is the outcome of my self-learning about the API Testing Automation framework - Rest-assured. I heard a lot about Rest-Assured and how it made the QA's life easier by helping them to run all the tedious API tests in an efficient way. Hence, I started learning about the framework and have documented all my learnings in this repository with all example code from writing basic tests to running end to end API automation tests.

This basic framework can be useful to anyone who want to get started on testing any API using [Rest Assured] (https://rest-assured.io/).
In this grameowrk I am using [Postman API endpoints] (https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-public-workspace/overview)

## üíº What does this repo contain?
This repo contains example codes of API Tests using Rest-Assured.
Junit Asserts are used for assertions.
Java Util Logging are used to capture logs.
Postman APIs has been used for testing.

You will get the answers to the following questions and its respective working code example with rest-assured framework in this repository:
How to handle the authentication requests?
How to write tests for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests?
How to pass Json Body payload to requests?
How to verify the Response Body?
How to verify the Response Status Code?
How to verify the Response headers?
How to extract value from Response Body?

**How to run Test**

    1. From IDE, run test as JUnit test
    2. From command line, run 'mvn clean test' from root folder
